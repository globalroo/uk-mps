## Brief description

A list of all current UK-MPs (with images) pulled from the excellent new beta parliament site https://beta.parliament.uk/. To see how the flattened data was acquired, please visit: https://github.com/globalroo/uk-mps-parser

Motivation? I'm listening to https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Memory-Power-Improve-Champion/dp/0743528662 at the moment, and one of the first chapters is about memorising names and faces. I figured it would be good to do this with our members of parliament, then I saw the APIs and thought it would be fun to combine two activities.

DISCLAIMER: This is VERY work in progress and should be categororised as 'tinkered with in front of the tv' at the moment.
